## 📖 Introduction

**vvtab** allows users to customize their browser's new tab page with a modular, component-based architecture. Build your dashboard like playing with LEGO blocks!

This project is currently in the early stages of development. I open-sourced it to invite developers and enthusiasts to collaborate. Let's build a beautiful and powerful start page together.
